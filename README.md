__Extras Guide__

First, you have to enable "Extras" in the menu (opens with /nn command)  
If you're very new to Skyblock/Cheating or just cba to set blocks yourself, you can download the [Default Config](https://github.com/Neionssss/Neion/blob/48ab103703c7cb6e903c5d3c1bcd0be94e854d12/DefaultConfigGuide.md)  

###### Otherwise {  

Next, as you enter the dungeon, use command /em (/editmode) to enter/leave the Edit Mode

While in edit mode:  
Your left click will set the block to air  
Right click will place the block you selected (Default one is Glass || /em *blockname* to select) [shortcuts](https://github.com/Neionssss/Neion/blob/91647197c786afcc73ba639ffe273fa5e037d564/shortcuts.md)  
Middle Click will set the selected block to one you're currently hovered
